**After Twitter changed its name, I started to feel like I didn't like everything about it. However, considering the impact of social media on our lives, it might be better for us to quit it altogether. Since there wasn't a suitable website for logging purposes to replace SNS, I built one with basic functionalities for only personal use. It's just a Tweeterlike webApp, but maybe something more will be added later?**
