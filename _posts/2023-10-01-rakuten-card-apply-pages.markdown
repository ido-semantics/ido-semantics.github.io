**Through this page, users can easily apply for a Rakuten credit card, completing the application process in just a few simple steps. It is designed to offer a secure and fast application procedure, allowing you to enjoy various benefits and conveniences.**

Our front-end team has designed the Rakuten credit card application page with user experience as the top priority. For this purpose, we developed and utilized our own CSS library based on Bootstrap. This library supports responsive design, providing a consistent user experience across all devices. In terms of design, we have created an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies and eases the application process.

For the front-end development of the page, we utilized Vue.js and Nuxt. Vue.js is an extremely useful framework for building dynamic user interfaces, while Nuxt simplifies server-side rendering of Vue.js applications, greatly aiding in SEO optimization. This combination of technologies has allowed us to enhance security through client-side and server-side validation checks and improve the page's visibility through search engine optimization.

Moreover, we designed the page with the user experience in mind across various environments, including PC, mobile, and tablet. Responsive web design ensures that the display is optimized for each device, allowing users to have the best application experience regardless of the device they are using. This approach focuses on increasing user satisfaction and maximizing the efficiency of the application process.
